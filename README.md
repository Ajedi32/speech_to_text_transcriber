# Speech to Text Transcriber

This cleverly named application continuously transcribes speech to text in real time using the [web speech API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html). It currently only supports Chrome, as support for the web speech API [isn't very widespread in other browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-speech).

Speech to Text Transcriber is designed as an inexpensive solution for assisting the hearing-impaired in situations where lip reading just doesn't cut it, and where hiring a professional to create live closed captions or translate to ASL would be cost-prohibative.
